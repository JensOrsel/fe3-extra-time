# Extra Time

This readme shows how I've spent my time besides the assignments/assessments, with this course in mind.

## MDN

Everytime I ran into an issue that had more to do with my JavaScript knowledge than my d3 knowledge, I went to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/) to see how to fix it. A lot of what I had to look up included how to work with arrays, `.concat` and `.join` in particular.

## D3 API

Manipulating the example presented to us during class took some knowledge of d3's features, which I obviously did not have at the start of the course. I put quite some time into reading the D3 API, specifically the items shown below (from my assessment 1 sources):

* [d3.timeParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#timeParse)
* [d3.select](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#select)
* [d3.scaleTime()](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#scaleTime)
* [d3.scaleLinear()](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#scaleLinear)
* [d3.line](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#line)
* [d3.csv](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#csv)
* [d3.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#extent)
* [d3.axisBottom()](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#axisBottom) and [d3.axisLeft()](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#axisLeft)

## StackOverflow

For other issues I encountered that involved more JavaScript than d3, I reached out to StackOverflow to learn more about specific issues.

## Lynda

I put some hours into the following [Lynda tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/D3-js-tutorials/Welcome/594451/619549-4.html?org=hva.nl), to get a better understanding of how d3 actually works, rather than changing up examples.

## W3Schools

W3Schools came in wherever I couldn't figure out something with MDN.

## Sources for assignments/assessments

You can check the sources in the readme's for my assignments/assessments: The assignments can be found in different branches of the fork from the course repo: [here](https://github.com/JensOrsel/course-17-18)

The assessments can be found from my profile.
